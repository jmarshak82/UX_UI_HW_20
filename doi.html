                <h1>The Problem</h1>
                <p>It's no secret that government agency websites rarely get the attnetion they need and/or deserve. The
                    current structure of the Department of the Interior website yields a user experience that is often
                    times
                    counter-intuitive, navigation filled with repetition, and lacks overall visual appeal.</p>

                Interior website which offers a more user friendly experience and is more visually appealing.</p>

                    information architecture to make the navigation more clear. Time for a card sort (virtually of

                <p>With research in hand, it was time to lay out what the new version of the site was going to look
                    like.
                    Using Figma, I was able to put together wireframes of the new flow. Through iteration, I was able to
                    simplify the pathway, expand on information, and keep the user on the DOI main site with only one
                    external link.</p>

                <p>Visual design was an important part of this project. How was I going to bring a fresh pespective,
                    visually, without overloading the user or packing too much on the pages so that the information is
                    now obscured by imagery? I called upon elements from Native American culture, National Park
                    photography, and a color pallete that was inspired by nature.</p>

                design.</p>

            <h2>Learning, Listening, Applying </h2>
            <p>I believe this quote from Dain Miller sums up this project best -
                “UI is the saddle, the stirrups, & the reins. UX is the feeling you get being able to ride the horse.”
            </p>
            <p>In order to execute a successful re-design, you have to consider the following:</p>
            <div class="designerThoughts" <ul>
                <li>Who are my users and what are their needs?</li>
                <li>Where does the current version fail and how do we improve it?</li>
                <li>With great vision comes great responsibility.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>In a very short period of time I was able to research, define, iterate, and design a new
                interpretation
                of an existing government agency website. Through application of all of these processes I was able
                to
                present a final product that, I believe, improves upon the existing version while encorporating my
                personal aethestic. Ultimately the biggest takeaway from this work is that no good design can be
                brought
                to life unless you take the journey in your user’s shoes.</p>
