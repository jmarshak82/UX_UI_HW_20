            <p>I'm Jeff, a professional oboist and UX/UI Designer living in Saint Paul,
                Minnesota.<br><br>
                I came to design from a background in music performance; a career field that nurtured
                a creative mind and developed a skillset focused on hard-work, attention to detail,
                collaboration, and human connection. My approach to design comes from the desire
                to understand a fully realized user journey and creating a product that is intuitive,
                userful, and visually appealing.</p>

        <h3>My UX Journey</h3>
        <img src="images/journey.png" class="image1">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p class="background">
            My love of music has always been a part of me, ever since I can remember. I earned a Bachelors, Masters,
            Performance Certificate, and Doctorate in Oboe performance. Over the course of my professional career I’ve
            cultivated a well-established performance resume that has taken me to festivals all over the world. I have
            performed with major orchestras including the Minnesota Orchestra, the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, and I
            currently hold the position of 2nd oboe/English Horn with the Minnesota Opera.<br><br>
            So, why design? I like to understand what makes the world tick. I truly believe that in order to understand
            the world around you, you have to ask questions and explore as much as possible. I see design as a synthesis
            of collaboration, research, and application of human experiences. I have been fortuante enough to experience
            a world full of art and culture and I have a desire to fold those experiences into design solutions for
            real-world problems. My years in orchestras has given me a unique perspective to understanding the bigger
            picture. Afterall, no symphony can be complete without every note being played. The finished product is the
            sum of the whole and thoughtful design is no different.<br><br>
            Outside of work hours I love to stay active. I play soccer with a local LGBTQ+ club, do Yoga everyday, and
            am an avid runner. I love to garden and landscape and I like to consider myself a fairly accomplished ‘home
            farmer.’ I also love to travel and I cannot wait to get back out in the world to explore!
